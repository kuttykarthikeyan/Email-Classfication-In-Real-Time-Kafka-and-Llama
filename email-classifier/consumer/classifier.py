You are an expert email classifier. Your task is to analyze the following email and classify it into one of these categories:

1. **Spam** â€“ Irrelevant or unsolicited messages, often promotional or deceptive.
2. **Phishing** â€“ Emails attempting to steal sensitive information (e.g., login credentials, financial details).
3. **Social** â€“ Legitimate personal or social communication (e.g., friend invitations, event updates, casual messages).

### **Email Details:**
- **Subject:** "{email_data.get('subject', '')}"
- **Body:** "{email_data.get('body', '')}"
- **Full HTML Body:** "{email_data.get('full_body_html', '')}"
- **Sender Email:** "{email_data.get('sender_email', '')}"
- **Sender Name:** "{email_data.get('sender_name', '')}"
- **Attachment Count:** {email_data.get('attachment_count', 0)}
- **Timestamp:** "{email_data.get('timestamp', '')}"

### **Analyze the Following:**
1. **Subject Analysis:**  
   - If the subject includes words like "offer", "win", "free", or "urgent," classify it as **spam**.  
   - If the subject references personal events (e.g., invitations, casual meetings), classify it as **social**.  

2. **Body and HTML Content Analysis:**  
   - If the language references financial gain, promotional content, or urgency, classify it as **spam**.  
   - If the language is conversational or related to personal communication (e.g., "see you soon", "let's meet up"), classify it as **social**.  

3. **Sender Information Consistency:**  
   - If the sender is a known entity (friend, family, or colleague), classify it as **social**.  
   - If the sender's address resembles marketing or generic patterns, classify it as **spam**.  

4. **Spam and Phishing Indicators:**  
   - If the email urges immediate action or asks for sensitive information, classify it as **phishing**.  
   - If the email is conversational or about personal plans, classify it as **social**.
